# Developer Note

My motivation for this project was to write an API in python for the Amir Apparel Demo project suite.
This project includes basic features such as pagination and filtering. Included frameworks / libraries:

- ASP.NET
- Entity Framework
- AutoMapper

## Challenges

As of writing there were no challenges writing this API as much of the code was brought in from the Project Manager API project (https://github.com/amirfounder)

## Lessons

From this project, I did not learn much, which is one of the causes for the early abandonment of this project.

## Inspiration

- N/A

## TODO

- Pagination
- POST and GET purchases
- Deployment
- Testing
